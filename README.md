# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

## Overview

This project is an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset highlights that a few microbial species (operational taxonomic units or OTUs) are present in a significant portion of the population, while others are relatively rare.

## Features

- **Interactive Data Visualization**: Utilizes D3.js to read and visualize data from `samples.json`.
- **Horizontal Bar Chart**: Displays the top 10 OTUs found in each individual.
- **Bubble Chart**: Represents each sample with bubble sizes and colors corresponding to OTU values.
- **Metadata Display**: Shows demographic information of each individual.
- **Dynamic Updates**: The dashboard updates all visualizations based on the selected sample from the dropdown menu.
